Python Showcase: Tic-Tac-Toe AI & Sales Data Visualization
This repository showcases two distinct Python projects. The first is a simple command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring a basic AI opponent. The second project focuses on data visualization, using matplotlib and pandas to analyze and plot company sales data.

ðŸ¤– File 1: Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent
A simple, interactive command-line application that simulates a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a basic AI. The project is built entirely with standard Python libraries.

Features
Game Board: A clean and easy-to-read 3x3 game board displayed in the terminal.

Win/Tie Detection: The program automatically checks for win conditions (three in a row, column, or diagonal) and tie games (a full board with no winner).

Simple AI Opponent: A straightforward AI agent that can play against a human user.

Main Game Loop: A robust loop that manages player turns, checks game status, and ensures the game flows correctly until a conclusion is reached.

How to Run
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

Execute the following command:

Bash

python tic_tac_toe.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

ðŸ“Š Part 2: Company Sales Data Visualization
This project demonstrates data analysis and visualization skills using Python's pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for creating plots. The script processes company sales data from a CSV file to generate insightful charts.

Dataset: The data used for this analysis can be found here: Company Sales Data CSV

Exercise 1: Total Profit Line Plot
This task reads the total profit for all months from the dataset and displays it as a line plot. This visualization helps in understanding the company's profit trend over the year.

Exercise 2: Bathing Soap vs. Facewash Sales Subplot
This task reads the sales data for two specific productsâ€”Bathing soap and Facewashâ€”and displays their monthly sales figures on separate subplots within the same figure. This allows for a clear, side-by-side comparison of their performance.

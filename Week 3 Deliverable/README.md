A brief exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the [Video Game Sales with Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) dataset from Kaggle. This project uses Python and Pandas to clean data, calculate key statistics, and uncover correlations between sales figures and review scores.

### ðŸ’¡ Key Findings

* **Sales are highly skewed:** A few blockbuster titles vastly outsell the average game, with median sales being much lower than the mean.
* **Critics seem to matter:** `Critic_Score` and `Critic_Count` show a moderate positive correlation with `Global_Sales`.
* **User scores are less impactful:** `User_Score` has a very weak correlation with `Global_Sales` in this dataset.
